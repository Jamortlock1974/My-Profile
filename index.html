 		<h2> A little about me</h2>
	    <p> I have loved books for as long as I can remember. I waited at the gate for the postman once a month when I was five, he delivered a magic slip letting me know my next Disney adventure had arrived at the post office. When I was twelve I walked into walls because I couldn't put Agatha Christie down to join my family for supper. I also got sent to the principal's office once during art class because my Moses received the ten commandments from a UFO (an adult had carelessly left an Eric Von Daniken thesis unattended). My children had their first library cards by the time they were four months old. I don't have a favourite author, that would require multiple alphabetical lists, arranged by genre, also alphabetically. This is a very loose collection of books with such an odd architecture that they always come to mind when I'm asked by friends "any recommendations on what I should read next?" </h2>
